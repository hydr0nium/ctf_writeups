Not a lot to this the flag is written in the description of the challenge:

>IMPORTANT

>If you are a US-based team competing for a cash prize, you MUST associate your team's country with "United States". This is how we will determine which teams win cash prizes at the end of an event. Once the event is officially over, we will tally the scores. If your team was not marked as a US team prior to the event ending, you WILL NOT qualify for one of the cash prizes.
