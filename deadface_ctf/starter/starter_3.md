# Starter 3
This is the first challenge that requires a bit of "searching" but nothing too difficult. Using the provided [Ghost Town](https://ghosttown.deadface.io/) link we can access the forum of deadface. Just following the description again the same way we did for starter 1 and starter 2.

>We need your help! DEADFACE has been wreaking havoc on several companies and individuals. Many of us have joined together to form Turbo Tactical, an organization of cybersecurity and infosec professionals and enthusiasts to help out DEADFACE's victims.
While performing some basic reconnaissance, we found a public Discourse forum called Ghost Town that DEADFACE uses to communicate with each other. We managed to get an insider to open the forum up to non-authenticated users. Use Ghost Town as a resource to find out what DEADFACE is up to and how they managed to execute their attacks.
