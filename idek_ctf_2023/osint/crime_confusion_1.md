## Challenge Description

>Someone has died unexpectedly. The police is on it, but between you and me, I cannot wait for the police. I am a private investigator and I need your help. Unfortunately, we might be tracked so I cannot give you the information directly. Start in a major social network. Certainly not a problem for the best hacker I know right...? Alright here goes a beautiful poem:
>
>
```
Some people in weird ways were connected 
Some were a triangle, some were less directed
For one night they all met
At doctor's Jonathan Abigdail the third they wept 
Things were said, threats in the air
A few days later someone is dead
Who is that someone? That is for you to find,
Also who is the killer, if you really don't mind.
```
>
>Note for the all the challenges: The challenge is divided into three challenges: Where, Weapon, and Who. Where is the first one the others will come later. In each one you can find the flag somwhere online. You might find the information in any order, however the expected order is: Where, Weapon and Who. Example: If the answer is knife then when you would discover that somewhere: like "the killer used a idek{knife_V5478G}" or instructions on how to get the flag: like idek{weaponUsed_V5478G}. The flag would then be idek{knife_V5478G}.

After reading the challenge description and the poem we can see that we need to search on a `major social network` and the only thing that immediately sticks out in the poem is the name `Jonathan Abigdail the Third`. Searching through Twitter, Facebook, Instragram etc. I finially found something on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/abigdail3djohn/).

There are a few things to take a look at but the most obvious one is the post on the profile. Looking through the other stuff we can see that there are not tagged posts and no one they are following. I also looked through the followers even though I was sure to not find anything there because I was assuming that most of the follows are other CTF players. Let's get to the post:
